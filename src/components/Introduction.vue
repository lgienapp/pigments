        <p>This color palette bridges the historical world of natural pigments with modern digital design needs. Inspired by the rich tradition of naturally occurring pigments that have colored human creations for millennia, we've carefully crafted a system that honors these timeless hues while meeting contemporary accessibility standards.</p>
        <p>Our process involved selecting five primary colors based on significant historical pigments, then developing perceptually uniform variants across the luminance spectrum. Each set of hues maintains color integrity at every light level while remaining colorblind-friendly and meeting WCAG contrast accessibility guidelines, ensuring both aesthetic harmony and practical usability.</p>
        <p>The result is a palette that connects our digital present with our artistic pastâ€”colors with stories to tell and practical applications for modern design challenges.</p>
